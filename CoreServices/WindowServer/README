Building the WindowServer:
`make clean && make`
Run the resulting WindowServer.app/Contents/Airyx/WindowServer on
a console tty.

Building the demo client to exercise WLWindow:
`make -f Makefile.client clean && make -f Makefile.client`
Run the resulting gltest.app/Contents/Airyx/gltest on a console tty.

The files belonging to the client will eventually be moved into
AppKit to replace X11.subproj.
